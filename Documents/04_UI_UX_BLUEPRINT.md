## 🎯 UX Objective

Nova-X is designed to **feel like a modern standalone SaaS**—while living entirely inside the WordPress Admin.

By combining **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, the interface delivers:
- Instant feedback
- Fluid navigation
- Zero page reloads

> _WordPress shell. SaaS soul._

---

## 🗺️ Interface Hierarchy

The Nova-X dashboard is structured into **four high-efficiency zones**, each optimized for a specific cognitive task.

## 🛠️ Visual Design Tokens

Nova-X enforces a **strict design token system** via Tailwind configuration to maintain visual coherence and performance.

| Token | Value / Purpose | Implementation |
|----|----|----|
| **Primary Color** | Dark mode slate with indigo accent | `bg-slate-900`, `text-indigo-400` |
| **Typography** | Inter / System Sans-Serif | `font-sans` |
| **Spacing** | 4px grid system | `p-4`, `m-2`, `gap-4` |
| **Radius** | Soft rounded edges | `rounded-lg` |
| **Transitions** | Fast ease-in-out (150ms) | `transition-all duration-150` |

> _Design tokens are law. Consistency scales._
