# 🚀 Nova-X | AI Theme Architect
> **The future of WordPress design.** Build, style, and architect entire themes using the power of AI and Tailwind CSS.

---

## 🎨 Visual Identity & Purpose
Nova-X isn't just a plugin; it's an **AI-driven ecosystem** for WordPress developers. It bridges the gap between creative intent and technical execution by translating natural language into production-ready code.

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Generation** | Real-time creation of PHP/Tailwind components. | ✅ Active |
| **Live Preview** | Instant visual feedback in a sandboxed iframe. | 🛠️ In-Dev |
| **Tailwind Engine** | Automated styling without writing a single line of CSS. | ✅ Active |
| **One-Click Export** | Move from Localhost to Production seamlessly. | 📅 Planned |

## 🏗️ Architecture Framework
The project is built on a modular "Bridge" architecture to ensure speed and security.

I understand perfectly now. You are looking for a high-quality README.md file for your GitHub repository. In the world of GitHub, this file is the visual identity; it’s what people see when they land on your project.

I have prepared a professional, visually structured version using Markdown "tricks" like shields, tables, and blockquotes to make it look clean and sophisticated.

Copy and Save this as README.md in your project root:

### **Why this works for your GitHub identity:**
1.  **Shields & Badges:** Use icons and bold headers to grab attention immediately.
2.  **Mermaid Diagram:** GitHub automatically renders that "graph LR" code into a professional visual flowchart.
3.  **Tables & Callouts:** The `[!NOTE]` block creates a stylized info box that looks like official documentation.
4.  **Clear Status:** Using emojis (✅, 🛠️) allows anyone to understand the project status at a glance.
