## 🎨 Visual Identity & Purpose
Nova-X isn't just a plugin; it's an **AI-driven ecosystem** for WordPress developers. It bridges the gap between creative intent and technical execution by translating natural language into production-ready code.

| **AI Generation** | Real-time creation of PHP/Tailwind components. | ✅ Active |
| **Live Preview** | Instant visual feedback in a sandboxed iframe. | 🛠️ In-Dev |
| **Tailwind Engine** | Automated styling without writing a single line of CSS. | ✅ Active |
| **One-Click Export** | Move from Localhost to Production seamlessly. | 📅 Planned |

I understand perfectly now. You are looking for a high-quality README.md file for your GitHub repository. In the world of GitHub, this file is the visual identity; it’s what people see when they land on your project.

I have prepared a professional, visually structured version using Markdown "tricks" like shields, tables, and blockquotes to make it look clean and sophisticated.

Copy and Save this as README.md in your project root:
