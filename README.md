## 💎 The Vision
**Nova-X** is a revolutionary AI-driven ecosystem designed for modern WordPress architects. It transforms human creative intent into production-ready block themes by bridging the gap between natural language prompts and technical Tailwind CSS execution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Nova-X** is currently in active development. It is built to empower developers to build faster, style smarter, and architect better.

## 🛠️ Integrated Architecture
The Nova-X engine operates on a three-tier "Smart Logic" framework to ensure code quality and design consistency.
